# leaflet-challenge


In this lesson we were tasked with plotting the location of earthquakes using geoJason data, color coding according to magnitude (depth) and 
varying circle marker size according to magnitude.


Most of the code was from the js leaflet dictionary and is referenced in the code.


I chose a basic graph with earthquakes from recent week.


Challenges included centering zooming such a large area such earthquakes were visible and distinguishable.
